## üì§ Outputs

| Output | Description |

| `first_upload_url` | URL of the first uploaded file (for single file uploads) |

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Pattern Matching
The action supports powerful glob patterns:

- `**/*` - All files recursively
- `*.js` - All JavaScript files in current directory
- `src/**/*.{js,ts}` - All JS/TS files in src directory
- `!**/*.test.js` - Exclude test files (when used in exclude)

### Concurrency Tuning
Adjust concurrency based on your needs:
- **Small files**: Higher concurrency (20-50)
- **Large files**: Lower concurrency (5-10)
- **Network limited**: Conservative (3-5)

### Storage Classes
- **STANDARD**: Frequently accessed data
- **WARM**: Infrequently accessed data
- **COLD**: Long-term archival

### URL Generation
The action automatically generates URLs for uploaded files:

- **Public files** (`public_read: true`): Direct URLs that can be accessed immediately
- **Private files**: Pre-signed URLs valid for 1 hour that provide temporary access

URLs are available in two outputs:
- `upload_urls`: JSON array of all uploaded file URLs
- `first_upload_url`: Direct access to the first uploaded file URL (useful for single file uploads)

Example of using URLs in subsequent steps:
```yaml
- name: Upload and deploy
  id: upload
  uses: diverger/gh-obs-helper@v1
  with:
    # ... upload configuration
    public_read: true

- name: Update deployment
  run: |
    curl -X POST "${{ env.DEPLOY_WEBHOOK }}" \
      -d "url=${{ steps.upload.outputs.first_upload_url }}"
```
